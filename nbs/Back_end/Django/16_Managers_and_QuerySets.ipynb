    "### 1. **What are Managers in Django?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **manager** in Django is the interface through which **database query operations** are provided to Django models. Every model in Django has at least one manager, and by default, Django provides a `Manager` object called `objects`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. **Default Manager**\n",
    "By default, every model has a manager named `objects`, which allows you to interact with the model’s database records.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example model\n",
    "class Book(models.Model):\n",
    "    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n",
    "    author = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n",
    "    published_date = models.DateField()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the default manager to query the database\n",
    "books = Book.objects.all()  # Retrieves all books\n",
    "book = Book.objects.get(id=1)  # Retrieves a specific book by ID\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. **Custom Manager**\n",
    "You can create a custom manager to encapsulate logic specific to your model, allowing for more readable and reusable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Custom manager\n",
    "class BookManager(models.Manager):\n",
    "    def published_last_year(self):\n",
    "        last_year = timezone.now().year - 1\n",
    "        return self.filter(published_date__year=last_year)\n",

    "### 2. **The Role of QuerySets in Django**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **QuerySet** represents a collection of database queries that return a set of results. QuerySets are lazily evaluated, meaning that the database query is only executed when the QuerySet is evaluated (e.g., when iterating over it or converting it to a list).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. **Basic QuerySet Operations**\n",
    "QuerySets allow you to filter, order, and retrieve data from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Retrieving all objects\n",
    "books = Book.objects.all()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Filtering objects\n",
    "filtered_books = Book.objects.filter(author=\"George Orwell\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Chaining filters (AND logic)\n",
    "recent_books = Book.objects.filter(published_date__year=2020).filter(author=\"George Orwell\")\n",

    "# Limit number of results (slicing)\n",
    "first_ten_books = Book.objects.all()[:10]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. **QuerySet Evaluation**\n",
    "A QuerySet is **lazily evaluated**, meaning the query is not actually executed in the database until the QuerySet is iterated over or explicitly evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of when QuerySets are evaluated:\n",
    "- **Iterating** over the QuerySet.\n",
    "- **Slicing** the QuerySet.\n",
    "- **Serializing** the QuerySet (e.g., converting it to a list or calling `len()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Query is not executed yet\n",
    "books = Book.objects.filter(author=\"George Orwell\")\n",

    "### 3. **Creating Custom Managers**\n",
    "\n",
    "Django allows you to define custom managers to encapsulate common queries, making your code more modular and readable. A custom manager can be defined by subclassing `models.Manager`.\n",

    "class PublishedBookManager(models.Manager):\n",

    "    # Define two managers: a default manager and a custom manager\n",
    "    objects = models.Manager()  # Default manager\n",
    "    published = PublishedBookManager()  # Custom manager for published books\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- `Book.objects.all()` will return all books.\n",
    "- `Book.published.all()` will return only books that have a `published_date`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. **Multiple Managers**\n",
    "You can define multiple managers in a single model to access different sets of query logic.\n",

    "### 4. **Custom QuerySets**\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of overriding the manager, you can create a custom QuerySet and use it directly in your model manager. This method allows you to chain custom QuerySet methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. **Creating a Custom QuerySet**\n",

    "```python\n",

    "        return self.filter(author=author_name)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use the custom QuerySet in a manager\n",
    "class BookManager(models.Manager):\n",
    "    def get_queryset(self):\n",
    "        return BookQuerySet(self.model, using=self._db)\n",

    "\n",
    "    objects = BookManager()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can chain custom QuerySet methods together:\n",

    "books = Book.objects.published().by_author(\"George Orwell\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "books = Book.objects.published().by_author(\"J.K. Rowling\").order_by('published_date')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c. **Combining Managers and QuerySets**\n",
    "\n",
    "A common pattern is to define both custom QuerySets and managers, allowing you to use manager-level logic while preserving the ability to chain QuerySet methods.\n",
